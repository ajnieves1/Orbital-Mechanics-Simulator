This project takes user input on the position, mass, and velocity of a satellite that is orbitting space. The program then draws a satellite object that traverses the screen based on the user's input, and Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation. 

The gravitational force between two masses is calculated using Newton's law of universal gravitation: [ F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} ] where:  
F is the gravitational force,
G is the gravitational constant 
m_1 and m_2 are the masses of the two objects
r is the distance between the centers of the two masses.

The velocity of the satellite is updated based on the gravitational force and the time step:
v is the updated velocity,
v0 is the initial velocity,
F is the gravitational force,
m is the mass of the satellite,
Delta t is the time step.

The position of the satellite is updated based on its velocity and the time step: 
s is the updated position,
s_0 is the initial position,
v is the velocity,
Delta t is the time step


Program GUI was made in JavaFX
